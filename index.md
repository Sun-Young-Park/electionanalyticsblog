There has been (and is still) much discussion about the state of American politics. Since Donald Trump's election in 2016, this discussion has become increasingly 
intense as reports from `[Pew] (https://www.pewresearch.org/topics/political-polarization/)` indicate that Americans are more polarized than last election cycle in
regard to race and gender, while Gallup https://news.gallup.com/opinion/polling-matters/268982/impact-increased-political-polarization.aspx addresses the challenges
of increased polarization and the Atlantic https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2018/11/why-are-americans-so-geographically-polarized/575881/ attempts to 
discern just why we Americans are so polarized. I too am interested in this question, and decided to study it this week using data on the percentage of party vote
share in America.
