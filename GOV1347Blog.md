There has been (and is still) much discussion about the state of American politics. Since Donald Trump's election in 2016, this discussion has become increasingly 
intense as reports from [Pew](https://www.pewresearch.org/topics/political-polarization/) indicate that Americans are more polarized than last election cycle 
in regard to race and gender, while [Gallup](https://news.gallup.com/opinion/polling-matters/268982/impact-increased-political-polarization.aspx) addresses the 
challenges
of increased polarization and [the Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2018/11/why-are-americans-so-geographically-polarized/575881/) attempts to 
discern just why we Americans are so polarized. I too am interested in this question, and decided to study it this week using data on the percentage of party vote
share in America. 

Using the data that we were given this week, I calculated the margin of victory for each party. I then plotted the margin for each state that the Republican party
won for the five election cycles since 2000. After I did this, I calculated the line of best fit to show trends between the elections as the share of the vote 
moved up or down.
